# iPhone-Yahoo-Notes-backup
A way to back up your iPhone's notes when they're synced to Yahoo. iPhone notes are synced into a Notes folder in your email
inbox, and saved as an email. This script will pull your notes emails from notes folder and save them as html files that 
you can then use to populate a new notes program that sucks less than the iPhone's native app. It will also help with the 
problem of disappearing notes that seems to occur.
